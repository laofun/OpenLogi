//! OS-level mouse-event hook for OpenLogi.
//!
//! On macOS the hook is implemented with `CGEventTap` (the same primitive used
//! by Logi Options+ and external-reference). Linux and Windows return
//! [`HookError::Unsupported`] from [`Hook::start`] — stubs that let the
//! workspace compile on all platforms without feature-gating callers.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use openlogi_hook::{Hook, MouseEvent, EventDisposition};
//!
//! if !Hook::has_accessibility() {
//!     eprintln!("grant Accessibility access first");
//!     return;
//! }
//!
//! let hook = Hook::start(|event| {
//!     println!("{event:?}");
//!     EventDisposition::PassThrough
//! }).unwrap();
//!
//! // … later, on shutdown:
//! hook.stop();
//! ```
