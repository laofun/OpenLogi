//! Implements the different HID++ wireless receivers.
//!
//! Because of the lack of public documentation about the different receivers
//! and their capabilities, and because I currently only own a single Bolt
//! receiver, this module is largely incomplete. I would be more than happy for
//! anyone who owns a different receiver, with Unifying having the highest
//! priority, and who is willing to actively support its implementation by
//! providing information and testing.
//!
//! Receivers can generally only be differentiated by their USB vendor and
//! product IDs, so the [`detect`] function does nothing more than matching
//! those values to the sets of known vendor and product ID pairs of the
//! different receivers.
